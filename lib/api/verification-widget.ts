/**
 * Data layer for the embeddable public proof-verification widget
 * (issue #196).
 * =================================================================
 *
 * Unlike `lib/api/activity.ts` and `lib/api/capabilities.ts`, this module
 * talks to a REAL, already-shipped backend endpoint: `GET
 * /proofs/{proofId}/verify` (see `VerifyProofResponse` in
 * `lib/api/generated/v1.ts`, and `components/verification/verify-proof-form.tsx`
 * for the existing non-embed caller of the same endpoint). There is no new
 * backend contract here — this file only adds an embed-appropriate,
 * narrower way to call it.
 *
 * Security/privacy contract:
 * - The widget only ever accepts a PUBLIC proof/verification identifier as
 *   input (from the route's `[id]` segment). It never accepts, stores, or
 *   forwards a bearer token, session cookie, or private credential JSON —
 *   `fetchWidgetVerification` below calls `apiClient` with no
 *   `Authorization` header, exactly like the public (non-embed) verify
 *   flow already does.
 * - The identifier is validated with the SAME allow-list
 *   (`isApprovedProofId`) the rest of the app already uses for
 *   attacker-controlled proof-id-shaped input (QR payloads, the `?proof=`
 *   query param) before it is ever interpolated into a URL — see
 *   `lib/validation/qr-payload.ts`. An identifier that fails this check is
 *   treated as `invalid` without ever reaching `fetch`.

/**
 * Widget entry point version. Bumped whenever the widget's rendered
 * contract (props/response shape a relying-party page can depend on)
 * changes in a way that isn't backward compatible. Surfaced in the route
 * (`/embed/v1/verify/[id]`) so an old embed snippet on a relying-party
 * site keeps working against the version it was generated for even after
 * a newer version ships.
