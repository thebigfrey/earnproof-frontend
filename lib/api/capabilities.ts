/**
 * Capability gating — UX layer only, never a security boundary.
 * =================================================================
 *
 * This module lets routes/actions show or hide themselves based on a
 * "capability document" the client holds. It exists purely to avoid
 * showing controls for backend functionality that isn't available yet
 * (a route behind a partial rollout, a network the API doesn't support,
 * an API version the deployed frontend has outdated assumptions about).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — read before using `useCapability`/`isCapabilityEnabled`
 * anywhere:
 *
 * 1. This is NOT an authorization system. The backend is the only thing
 *    that may decide whether a request is actually allowed to succeed.
 *    Every mutation and every read of sensitive data MUST still be
 *    enforced server-side, exactly as if this module did not exist.
 * 2. Treat every value here as attacker-controlled UX hint, not fact. A
 *    user can trivially edit the cached document in devtools, disable
 *    JS execution of the fail-closed check, or hand-craft a request that
 *    never goes through gated UI at all. None of that should grant them
 *    anything the server wouldn't otherwise allow.
 * 3. Do not use this module to decide whether to render sensitive data
 *    that was already fetched — only whether to *offer* the action that
 *    would fetch/submit it. The server response (or its absence) is the
 *    actual gate.
 * 4. This client-side mock provider (`fetchMockCapabilityDocument`) is a
 *    stand-in for a future server endpoint. The real EarnProof API
 *    (`lib/api/openapi/earnproof-api.v1.json`) does not expose a
 *    capability document today — nothing here talks to a real backend
 *    path. When/if a real endpoint ships, only the fetcher needs to
 *    change; the gating contract (fail closed, cache invalidation,
 *    "never a security boundary") must not.
 *
 * Fail-closed contract: any capability key not present (or not `true`)
 * in the resolved document is treated as disabled. A stale, missing, or
 * malformed document also resolves to "no capabilities enabled" rather
 * than throwing — callers should never crash because this module 404s.
