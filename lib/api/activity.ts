/**
 * Recent account activity — types, redaction, and a local mock/stub data
 * provider.
 * =================================================================
 *
 * This is a FRONTEND-ONLY feature today. There is no activity/audit-log
 * endpoint in `lib/api/openapi/earnproof-api.v1.json` — `fetchActivityEvents`
 * below is a fixture, not a call to a real backend path. When a real
 * endpoint exists, only the fetcher needs to change: the event shape,
 * redaction contract, and pagination shape are designed to match what a
 * server-provided-pagination endpoint would plausibly return.
 *
 * Security/privacy contract (per issue #198's acceptance criteria):
 * - Events must already be scoped to the authenticated user/organization
 *   by the server; this module never merges events across sessions.
 * - Sensitive identifiers (IP addresses, session tokens, API key IDs,
 *   wallet addresses) are truncated/omitted by `redactActivityEvent`
 *   before an event is considered renderable — never displayed raw.
 * - An event whose `type` this frontend doesn't recognize must still
 *   render safely (see `components/activity/unknown-event.tsx`) rather
 *   than crash or leak unredacted fields.
