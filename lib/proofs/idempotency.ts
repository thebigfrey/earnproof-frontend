/**
 * Idempotency-key lifecycle shared by every proof-creation request
 * (minimum-income, recurring-income, aggregate-earnings, income-range).
 *
 * The backend contract for these POST /proofs/* endpoints does not yet
 * define an Idempotency-Key header (see lib/api/openapi/earnproof-api.v1.json)
 * — this is deliberately forward-compatible and defense-in-depth on the
 * frontend side: sending a stable key for retries of the same submission
 * intent is harmless if the backend ignores the header today, and lets it
 * dedupe safely the moment it starts honoring one, without a frontend
 * change. It does not, by itself, guarantee server-side deduplication.
 *
 * `ProofIntent` is intentionally just "a JSON-serializable record" rather
 * than one fixed shape: each proof type's submission payload differs
 * (thresholdAmount vs. lower/upperBound vs. sources+policy), but all of them
 * need the same treatment — a stable signature that a same-intent retry can
 * be recognized by. `selectedPaymentIds`/`sourceIds`, if present, are
 * sorted so key ordering in a caller's selection doesn't change the
 * signature; every other field is compared as-is.
