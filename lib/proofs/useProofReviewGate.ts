/**
 * Gates a proof submission behind an explicit review-and-confirm step,
 * built around one frozen snapshot of the exact payload that will be sent.
 *
 * Why a frozen snapshot rather than re-deriving the payload at submit time:
 * this issue requires "the reviewed payload is byte-equivalent to the
 * submitted payload" and "changes after review invalidate confirmation."
 * Re-deriving the payload from live state at submit time can never
 * guarantee byte-equivalence with whatever was rendered a moment earlier —
 * the only way to guarantee it is to build the payload once, freeze it, and
 * submit that exact object. Confirmation is invalidated the instant the
 * live payload no longer matches (by value) the frozen one, which callers
 * detect by calling `refreshLiveSnapshot` whenever a dependency of the
 * builder changes (e.g. in a useEffect) — this hook does not itself know
 * which state a given flow's builder reads, so it cannot poll on its own.
