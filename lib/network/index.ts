/**
 * Network resilience and offline/degraded recovery primitives.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - Error classification: distinguish offline, server, validation, auth failures
 * - Network status: track online/offline and degraded states
 * - Request deduplication: prevent overlapping concurrent requests
 * - Request sequencing: prevent out-of-order responses from overwriting fresh state
 * - Enhanced API errors: carry classification and recovery context
