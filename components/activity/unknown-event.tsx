/**
 * Safe fallback renderer for an activity event whose `category` this
 * frontend build doesn't recognize (e.g. served by a newer backend
 * version, or a future event type rolled out ahead of this deploy).
 *
 * Deliberately renders NONE of the event's raw fields — only its id and
 * timestamp, if present and string-shaped. Any other field could be an
 * unredacted identifier the redaction contract in `lib/api/activity.ts`
 * never got a chance to mask, so printing it here would be a privacy
 * leak, not just a cosmetic gap.
